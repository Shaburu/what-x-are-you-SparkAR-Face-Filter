  How the Filter Works
in layman's terms, there is a sequence of the cat images stored and based on when you run the program (press the record button) that's when the runtime starts and i take That and randomize that while also converting it into a float and assiging it to the respective sequence of the cat. This was coded in Javascript and SparkAR was used to place the 3D Planes in the spatial space
